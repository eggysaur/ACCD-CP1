        <h1>Blender Prototype Process</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Sort of inspired by by the app carousels in the google play store, I wanted to make a similar scene that just shows the ideal space the app would be used; an office. Perhaps the implication is during work from home hours.</p>
        <img src="images/1.png">
        <p>Sort of like this but imagine it.... on a DESK!</p>
        <p>
        Also with the nature of 3D software I kinda just wanted to take advantage of the rendering software to render some pretty lighting- it feels like such a hack since its so simple yet dramatic.
        </p>

        <h2>Gathering Assets</h2>
        <p>So I wasn't actually sure if we were allowed to just rip everything from sketchfab which is why I turned this in late. I would've been kind of embarassed if I just turned in something completely unacceptable. Glad it was actually expected!</p>
        
        <p>The first steps I took was simply finding the assets I wanted online starting with a desk. Here's the simple desk I found that suited the realistic style I wanted to render.</p>
        <a href="https://skfb.ly/6BRuF"><img src="images/desk.png"></a>
        <br>
        <p>Naturally, I needed an office chair after this. </p>
        <a href="https://skfb.ly/pBXvO"><img src="images/chair.png"></a>
           <br>
        <p>A lovely laptop to put on the desk!</p>
        <a href="https://skfb.ly/oSUrn"><img src="images/xps15.png"></a>
          <br>
        <p>And lastly, the most important- a phone to show my prototype on!</p>
        <a href="https://skfb.ly/6WoUB"><img src="images/iphone.png"></a>
        <p>Look how nice and shiny it is! Let's get to assembling.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Simple Assembly</h2>
        <p>This was actually kinda confusing cause I couldn't figure out how to import the desk as a blend file without looking the texture. Figured it out in class, but using the .gltf file is much more convenient anyway...</p>
        <img src="images/2.png">
        <p>Ok so desk and chair. Now we need some simple walls and a window</p>
        <img src="images/3.png">
        <p>Drawn arrow is the angle of light I want, so that half the light hits the phone. I just think it would be pretty (and simple)</p>
        <img src="images/4.png">
        <p>I slap that laptop on the desk. I dunno if its actually flush or clipping the desk. To be honest, it doesn't really matter.</p>
        <img src="images/5.png">
        <p>Put the iphone down at a sort of natural angle.</p>
        <p>I don't know what's up with the gltf files, but they are a bit strange to move around in blender. I didn't figure out for a while that I need to select hierarchy- shouldn't selecting the parent just select everything? I dunno.</p>
        <p>I end up putting them all in individual collections just to manage them.</p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <h2>Finishing Adjustments</h2>
        <p>I add an emission to the iphone, cause it's a screen and it glows.</p>
        <img src="images/6.png">
        <p>I dunno how to save a figma as a png so I take a screenshot and crop it in paint tool sai. I feel like a caveman...</p>
        <img src="images/7.png">
        <br>
        <p>And oh my god, I realize I designed my protoype on a Samsung. Ok so I switch phone models. <a href = "link">Beautiful Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra.</a>(I want this phone...)</p>
        <img src="images/8.png">
        <p>I also go ahead and fix the scale, as the iphone was actually huge, and the samsung is actually bigger. More realistic size comparison.</p>
        <img src="images/10.png">
        <p>Fix the UV mapping. Surprisingly easy, wonder if there's a way to get everything to snap perfectly or if all textures are freehand like this.</p>
        <img src="images/11.png">
        <p>Render setup and adjusting the light just right...</p>
        <img src="images/12.png">
        <p>Set to render. Does the ETA say it's going to take a whole day? I actually think it is! </p>
    </div>
