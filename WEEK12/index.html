                I wanted to make a video game based off object recognition in p5js- not a super serious game, a silly one. Here are the process images and notes!

            <p>The goal is not to make a super serious game, but moreso a silly one by grabbing random objects and being able to use them <i>inside</i> the game. </p>
            <p>It sort of takes advantage of the finnicky nature of the image recognizer- failed interactions are designed to happen... cause the results are funny. I often think this is one of the reasons why the concept of <b>game</b> is where one can practice <i>design</i> to its fullest potential, bad interactions don't have real consequences, or if anything, they are <i>meant</i> to frustrate the player. which is also funny.</p>

            <p>I've never used teachable machine so here was my first try. It's nice to know i can simply go back and fix my model if need be (i will definitely be doing that).</p>
            <img src="img/1.5.PNG" style="width:50%; margin-left:25%;">
            <p>Having made a game project before, I know it's kind of a pain but its totally doable. The hardest part... is learning how to integrate this damn camera without causing the whole site to lag. my god.</p>
            <img src="img/1.PNG" style="width:100%; ">
            <p>Here's how I code every game scene; each one will be a function, and in the draw function I will simply iterate a variable number so that these scene functions are on top of each other.</p>
            <img src="img/3.PNG" style="width:100%; ">
             <img src="img/2.PNG" style="width:100%; ">
             <p>And how I reduced lag- make classifyVideo run every other second instead of every second. It's shocking how much this improves the performance.</p>
            <img src="img/4.PNG" style="width:100%; ">
            <p>And that's it so far! Hopefully this is smooth sailing! The current version doesn't work super well, like for example the moment classifyVideo starts running it automatically detects a wave and sends you into the next scene. Not intended.</p>
