        <p>The extent of my experience with blender is modelling a low poly horse trying to copy the style of those youtube videos where they make a cute little anime girl model from planes. It was fine, I guess…</p>
    </div>
     <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>So for this assignment I figured I’d try making a cute
            little anime girl, once again biting off more than I could chew.
            Starting with the blender cube, I slowly carved out a squircle looking cube (squphere?)
            and immediately gave up once I realised I had to do hair.

    <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>Let's change it. It’s a cat head now! I think this is what blender artists call awful topology on the ears, but whatever.

    </div>

     <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>And I’m not gonna bother with the eyes. 2 spheres. One object, done!
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>Since I dont wanna do a cat body, I should hide the body behind a wall, and maybe make a mouse and a cheese object so that I can make a cute little narrative composition.

    <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>How the hell do you model a mouse? Wtf <br>
Also I forgot how to do that thing where you can sort of slightly drag the shape around :(

        <p>the ears were done by loop cutting a plane and adjusting the vertices. The tail is a cone i elongated and then just shrank. overall, the symmetry tool was my best friend, and I have no idea what im doing...

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px; background: none; min-height: 400px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        <img src="images/untitled.png" alt="cat head" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
    </div>

    <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>the cheese is just a cube where i loop-cut and extruded some holes inwards from wherever. its good enough for me.    

    </p>
    </div>
     <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>overall my process tends to not follow any kind of tutorial-which i have before! (blender guru donut) but somehow, when i follow such guides i generally seem to not remember anything from following these tutorials. i just hope i can brute force through and get what i want done, and just practicing more will probably do me good</p>
        <p>It would be helpful to be able to know more vocabulary, since i not only forgot how to do the stretch thing, but i have no idea what its even called so i cant even look it up</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nes-container is-rounded" style="margin: 20px;">
        <p>i think its pretty cute, the lighting comes through the hole not quite the way i wanted but close enough. I'd love to experiment more with lighting and shaders to see if i can achieve some kind of painterly look in the future if i continue to mess with blender (i really hope i do!)
